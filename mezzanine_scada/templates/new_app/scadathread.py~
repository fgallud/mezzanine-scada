This is a template to create a new app in scada_mezzanine

The creation process is:

1.- Create an app with the command:
  python3 manage.py startapp my_app
  
3.- inside the app directory add the models wanted (if needed)

4.- copy the scadathread.py file to the directory.
    This file have a scadathread class that is a thread.
    the mezzanine_scada service daemon will load an runs this thread. 
    This thread work is to run all threads needed for this app and act as this app daemon
    Typically this thread will do task like:
      - read the value of a list of sensors every some time and update his value in the realtime database
      - wait a change in a variable in the realtime database and do some task like control, alarms, etc...
    this class accepts:
      - the realtime database that is used to save variable values, read them or wait until a variable value changes
      - the end event. The thread must end if this event becomes true
      - a logger to send info, error, debug,.. messages
      

This code saves all sensor values in real time every now and then. 
It saves the data into plain text files. One file for each day. This is usefull because is easy to reacue the data if the computer has an error.
It creates a directory for each year, inside it creates a directory for each month and inside it creates a file for each day

TODO list
- Wait for an event that become true when the database is created instead of waiting 60s
- Save the mean value instead of pick one value
- Export accecpting start and end times in different days. Warning, if the time range is too large, it can freeze the program. May be a week?
  maybe the correct way is in javascript to make a lot of ajax commands. If there are too many only the navigator page freeze, not the server
