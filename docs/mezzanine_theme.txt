based on http://bitofpixels.com/blog/mezzatheming-creating-mezzanine-themes-part-1-basehtml/


the theme is in the base_theme directory in the repository. This is a how do I
did it. It is only useful to know how to modify the theme and to know how it works


python3 manage.py startapp base_theme

move the base_theme to the mezzanine_scada directory

in settings.py add the app 

"mezzanine_scada.base_theme",  must be the first app, before django load the
base theme.


mkdir /.../mezzanine_scada/base_theme/static

python3 manage.py collecttemplates -t base.html
mv templates/ /.../mezzanine_scada/base_theme

and then I copy and modify each file from html5-boilerplate web template
(currently v6.1.0) to the app template directory modifying the code to use
the django templates variables
